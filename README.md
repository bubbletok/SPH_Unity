- Fluid simulation by using **SPH** in Unity
- Unity Compute Shader for a parallel process of calculation between particles
- Visualization SPH using GPU instancing

## WIP
- Improve calculation speed using Spatial Grid method
- Divide layer as different density for each particle
- Implement mixed fluid, represent of blended colors with surrounding particles
